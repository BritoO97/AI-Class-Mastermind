run1 - 500,000 of random
run2 - 1,000,000 of random
run3 - 500,000 of five (no minimax)
run4 - 1,000,000 of five (no minimax)
run5 - 10,000 of five with minimax (extra time needed for minimax means less games)
run6 - 10,000 of five with the second minimax code (super slow)
run7 - 100,000 of five (no minimax) looking for different statistics
run8 - 15,000 of five with the second minimax code (super slow)
